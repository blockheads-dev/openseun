## About this Project
OpenSEUN is a platform where communities who decide to use energy saving methods to ensure clean water are rewarded with carbon credits. We help communities to access clean water and secure funding by selling carbon offsets as a result of cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Our Open Source software ensures that the data is being recorded accurately and then produces carbon credits.

**OpenSEUN** supports **Hedera Hashgraph** and can also work with any EVM compatible chain.

The platform ensures that projects follow the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changeâ€™s (UNFCCC) protocol for low greenhouse gas emitting water purification systems.

**H2OBonds** (as carbon credits) are minted as NFTs and can be sold on supported exchanges or marketplaces for example, **SEUNswap** our bounty submission.

Communities worldwide can monetize on carbon savings when they make wiser decisions to purify their water.

Corporations can purchase the H2OBonds and support global areas where their purchases can make a big difference, truly creating a healthy, encouraging, and green economy.
